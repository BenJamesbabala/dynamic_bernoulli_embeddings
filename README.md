### Dynamic Bernoulli Embeddings

This repository contains scripts for running (dynamic) Bernoulli embeddings on text data.
They have been run and tested on Linux. 

To execute, go into the source folder (`src/`) and run 

   ```python main.py --dynamic True --fpath [path/to/data]```

substitute the path to the folder where you put the data for `[path/to/data]`.
The data folder and files have to be structured in a specific format.
For your convenience, we included some scripts that will help you preprocess the text data in `dat/src/`. For instructions on the required data format see `dat/README.md`.

For all commandline options run:

   ```python main.py --help```

For fastest convergence we recommend the following 2-step training procedure.
First run

   ```python main.py --fpath [path/to/data]```

This executes Bernoulli embeddings without dynamics. The scripts uses the current timestamp to create a folder where the results are saved ([path/to/results/]). We will use these results to initialize the dynamic embeddings:

   ```python main.py --fpath [path/to/data] --init [path/to/result]/alpha_constant```

Make sure to use the same `--K` for both runs.
